# This works:

# name = 5 
# type = name.class
# This doesn't work:

# print "Enter the value to findout its class "
# name = gets
# type = name.class
# if type == String
#   puts "this is a string"
# elsif type == Fixnum
#   puts "this is a fixnum"
# else
#   puts "this is unknown type"
# end

# def is_number? string
# 	true if Float(string) rescue false
# end

# my_string = '12.34'

# puts is_number?(my_string)
